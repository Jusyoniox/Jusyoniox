Hello there. I am jusyoniox. I am a (quite alright) coder.
I tend to be making super Mario romhacks. They don't tend to be very good but whatever.
 Reach me here: jusyoniox@gmail.com
You can expect repositories, but they won't come often as I have only been coding for a good 9 months.
Even if you don't want to ask questions, you can still chat to me in discord: jusyoniox #5365.
I can use java, Linux, wine, termux (mobile Linux) and more! 
Do be patient as I am still learning alright?
Have a good day my brothers and sisters!
